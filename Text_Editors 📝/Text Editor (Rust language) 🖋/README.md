# Text Editor (Rust) ðŸ–‹

This is a simple text editor written in Rust that allows the user to enter and manipulate text, save the text to a file, and load text from a file.

## How it works

The text is stored in a `String` variable named `text`. The main loop repeatedly prompts the user for input, reads the input from the standard input stream, and processes the input based on the user's command.

The commands are:

- `"q"` to quit the program
- `"w"` to write the current text to a file
- `"a"` to append text from a file to the current text
- `"d"` to delete all the text

Any other input is treated as text to be added to the current text.

The `get_file_name` function prompts the user for a file name and returns it as a `String`. The `fs` module is used to read and write files.
