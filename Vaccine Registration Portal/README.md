# Vaccine Registration Portal

This is a simple C program for a vaccine registration portal. The program prompts the user to enter their name, age, and email address, and then displays the information back to the user.

## Installation

To install the program, simply download the `vaccine_registration.c` file and compile it using a C compiler. For example, if you're using GCC on Linux, you can compile the program with the following command:

```
gcc -o vaccine_registration vaccine_registration.c
```

This will create an executable file named `vaccine_registration`.

## Usage

To use the program, simply run the executable file:

```
./vaccine_registration
```

You will be prompted to enter your name, age, and email address. After you have entered this information, the program will display it back to you.
