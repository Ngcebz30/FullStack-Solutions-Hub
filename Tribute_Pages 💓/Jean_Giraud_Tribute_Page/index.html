                In 1954 at age 16, he began his only technical training at the
                <a href="https://duperre.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
                  École Supérieure des Arts Appliqués Duperré </a

              </a>

              <p>
                At 18, Giraud was drawing his own comic Western strip, "Frank et
                Jeremie", for the magazine "Far West", his very first commercial
                sale.<br /> From <strong>1956 to 1958</strong> he published Western
                comics, alongside several others of a French historical nature,
                in the magazines "Fripounet et Marisette", "Coeurs Valiants" and
                "Ames Valliantes" - all from catholic publisher Fleurus, and all
                of them of a strong edifying nature aimed at France's adolescent
                youth - among them a strip called
                <strong>"King of the Buffalo"</strong>, and another called
                <strong>"A Giant with the Hurons".</strong> <br /> It was for Fleurus
                that Giraud also illustrated his first three books. Already in
                this period his style was heavily influenced by his later
                mentor,<a href="https://www.lambiek.net/artists/j/jije.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                ><strong>Joseph "Jijé" Gillain</strong>.</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1961, returning from military service, Giraud became an
                apprentice of Jijé, who was one of the leading comic artists in
                Europe of the time. In his period, Jijé used Giraud as his
                assistant on an album of his Western series Jerry Spring,
                <strong>"The Road to Coronado"</strong>, which Giraud inked.
