              <p>John Muir, also known as the ‘Father of National Parks’, was a famous American conservationist, writer, naturalist and explorer, who promoted the conservation of wildlife in the United States of America and around the world. He effectively lobbied Congress to pass the National Park Bill. His activism helped the preservation of Sequoia National Park and the Yosemite Valley. He co-founded the Sierra Club, which today has over 1.3 million members and has helped establish a number of wildlife reserves.
