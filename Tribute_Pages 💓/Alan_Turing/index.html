    Here's a time line of Alan's life
  </h4>
      <ul class="timeline">
        <li><strong>1912</strong> - Born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maida_Vale"> Maida Vale</a>, London, England</li>
        <li><strong>1918</strong> - Turing's parents enrolled him at St Michael's, a day school at 20 Charles Road, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Leonards-on-Sea">St Leonards-on-Sea</a>, at the age of six. The headmistress recognised his talent
          early on, as did many of his subsequent educators.</li>
        <li><strong>1926</strong> - Alan went on to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherborne_School">Sherborne School</a>, an independent school in the market town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherborne">Sherborne</a> in Dorset. Turing's
          natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne, whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics.</li>
        <li><strong>1928</strong> - Aged 16, Turing encountered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Albert Einstein's</a> work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion">Newton's laws of motion</a>          from a text in which this was never made explicit.</li>
        <li><strong>1930</strong> - At Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom, who has been described as Turing's "first love". Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing's future endeavours, but it was
          cut short by Morcom's death, in February 1930, from complications of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_tuberculosis">bovine tuberculosis</a>, contracted after drinking infected cow's milk some years previously. <br><br>The event
          caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom.</li>
        <li><strong>1931</strong> - After Sherborne, Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_College,_Cambridge">King's College, Cambridge</a>, whence he gained first-class honours in mathematics.</li>
        <li><strong>1935</strong> - At the age of 22, Alan was elected a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow">fellow</a> of King's on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem">central limit theorem</a></li>
        <li><strong>1938</strong> - From September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church"> Alonzo Church</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University">Princeton University</a>.
          In addition to his purely mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier.</li>
        <li><strong>1939</strong> - On 4 September 1939, the day after the UK declared war on Germany, Turing reported to Bletchley Park, the wartime station of GC&CS.</li>
        <li><strong>1939</strong> - Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma#German_naval_Enigma">German naval Enigma</a> "because no one else was doing anything about
          it and I could have it to myself". In December 1939, Turing solved the essential part of the naval <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine#Indicator">indicator</a> system, which was more complex than the indicator systems used
          by the other services.</li>
        <li><strong>1941</strong> - In 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Clarke">Joan Clarke</a>, a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived. After admitting his
          homosexuality to his fianc√©e, who was reportedly "unfazed" by the revelation, Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage.</li>
        <li><strong>1942</strong> - During 1942, Alan and his colleagues also manage to break the more complicated German Naval Enigma system. This is a tremendous help to the Allies in the Battle of the Atlantic.</li>
        <li><strong>1945</strong> - At the end of the war, Alan Turing is awarded the OBE for his wartime services.</li>
        <li><strong>1952</strong> - Alan is arrested for gross indecency and loses his security clearance. He is offered chemical treatment as an alternative to imprisonment. The hormone treatment has a very detrimental effect on him.</li>
        <li><strong>1954</strong> - Died of cyanide poisoning under <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-18561092">disputed causes</a></li>
