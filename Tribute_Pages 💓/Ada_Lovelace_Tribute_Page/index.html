      <div class="early-life-text">
        <p class="text-secondary">Born in 1816 in London, England to poet George Lord Byron and his wife Anne Isabella Milbanke. Ada and her mother left Byron early in Ada's childhood and was primarily raised by her grandmother, Judith. Often ill, beginning in early childhood, suffering from vision impairing headaches and a bout with measles that left her briefly paralysed. She later was able to walk with the assistance of crutches.
        <br><br>
        Throughout her illnesses, Ada focused on her education. Her mother's obssession with avoiding the insanity that she believed inflicted Byron, was one of the reasons Ada was taught mathematics at an early age. She was privately schooled in mathematics and science by William Frend, William King, Mary Somerville, and Augustus De Morgan. In her late teens, De Morgan wrote to her mother regarding her potential in mathematics stating Ada was "an original mathematical investigator, prehaps of first-rate eminence".
        <br><br>
        Lovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively apply mathematical and scientific concepts. She valued metaphysics as much as mathematics, viewing both as tools for exploring "the unseen worlds around us".

        <p class="text-secondary">Lovelace first met Charles Babbage in 1833, through their mutual friend and Ada's former teacher Mary Somerville. Babbage invited Lovelace to see the prototype of his "Difference Engine". The "Difference Engine" was an automatic mechanical calculator designed to tabulate polynomial functions. It is considered to be an example of the earliest computer. Lovelace became fascinated with the machine. 
        <br><br>
        In 1842-43, Babbages friend Charles Wheatstone commissioned Ada to translate a transcript of one of Babbage's lectures, originally written in French, into English. Babbage's lecture regarded his newly proposed machine, the "Analytical Engine", given at the University of Turin.
        Ada not only translated the lecture, but supplemented it with additional notes that were around three times the length of the orinial text. Her notes included a method for calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers with the Engine, which some consider the world's first computer program. These notes and the original text were initially published in Taylor's "Scientific Memoirs" and later in 1953, where they were recognised as an early model for a computer and her notes as a description of a computer and software.
